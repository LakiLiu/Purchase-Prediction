This project is to predict the probability of the purchase, with highly imbalanced dataset

Retail Company want to suggest consumers products they are interested to buy. We track all user's acitivites across the wesite. The data includes the last purhcase time
as well as other features. C1 to C10 is the categorical features, and N1-N9 are numercial features. For the privacy, all the data is hashed.
